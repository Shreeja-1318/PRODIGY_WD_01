The Stopwatch Program is a simple web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This program allows users to start, stop, and reset a stopwatch with the click of a button.

- The stopwatch displays the current time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
- Clicking the "Start" button will start the stopwatch, and clicking the "Stop" button will pause the stopwatch.
- The "Reset" button clears the stopwatch and sets the time back to 00:00:00.
